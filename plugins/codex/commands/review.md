Run a Codex review through the shared built-in reviewer.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Model / effort:
- `--model` and `--effort` are runtime-selection flags (same as `/codex:rescue`).
- Omit `--model` / `--effort` unless the user asks; companion defaults to `gpt-6-astra` at `xhigh`.
- `sol` → `gpt-5.6-sol`; `spark` → `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`.
- Native review applies the model on `thread/start` (no effort field on `review/start`).

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your only job is to run the review and return Codex's output verbatim to the user.

Execution mode rules:
- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run the review in the foreground.
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run the review with `run_terminal_command` `background: true`.
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
  - For working-tree review, also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`.
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`.
  - Treat untracked files or directories as reviewable work even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty.
  - Only conclude there is nothing to review when the relevant working-tree status is empty or the explicit branch diff is empty.
  - Recommend waiting only when the review is clearly tiny, roughly 1-2 files total and no sign of a broader directory-sized change.
  - In every other case, including unclear size, recommend background.
  - When in doubt, run the review instead of declaring that there is nothing to review.
- Then use `ask_user_question` exactly once with two options, putting the recommended option first and suffixing its label with `(Recommended)`:
  - `Wait for results`
  - `Run in background`

Argument handling:
- Preserve the user's arguments exactly.
- Do not strip `--wait` or `--background` yourself.
- Do not add extra review instructions or rewrite the user's intent.
- The companion script parses `--wait` and `--background`. For background runs, Grok's `run_terminal_command` with `background: true` is what detaches the process; the companion still tracks the job for `/codex:status` and `/codex:result`.
- `/codex:review` is native-review only. It does not support staged-only review, unstaged-only review, or extra focus text.
- If the user needs custom review instructions or more adversarial framing, they should use `/codex:adversarial-review`.

Foreground flow:
- Run:
```bash
node "${GROK_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" review "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not fix any issues mentioned in the review output.

Background flow:
- Launch the review with `run_terminal_command` and `background: true`:
```text
command: node "${GROK_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" review "$ARGUMENTS"
description: Codex review
background: true
```
- Do not wait for completion in this turn.
- After launching the command, tell the user: "Codex review started in the background. Check `/codex:status` for progress."
